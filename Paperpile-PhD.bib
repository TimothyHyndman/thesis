  title     = "Frequent problems in calculating integrals and optimizing

  author    = "Delaigle, A and Gijbels, I",
  abstract  = "Many statistical procedures involve calculation of integrals or
               optimization (minimization or maximization) of some objective
               function. In practical implementation of these, the user often
               has to face specific problems such as seemingly numerical
               instability of the integral calculation, choices of grid points,
               appearance of several local minima or maxima, etc. In this paper
               we provide insights into these problems (why and when are they
               happening?), and give some guidelines of how to deal with them.
               Such problems are not new, neither are the ways to deal with
               them, but it is worthwhile to devote serious considerations to
               them. For a transparant and clear discussion of these issues, we
               focus on a particular statistical problem: nonparametric
               estimation of a density from a sample that contains measurement
               errors. The discussions and guidelines remain valid though in
               other contexts. In the density deconvolution setting, a kernel
               density estimator has been studied in detail in the literature.
               The estimator is consistent and fully data-driven procedures
               have been proposed. When implemented in practice however, the
               estimator can turn out to be very inaccurate if no adequate
               numerical procedures are used. We review the steps leading to
               the calculation of the estimator and in selecting parameters of
               the method, and discuss the various problems encountered in
               doing so.",

               considered and the important issue of how to choose the
               bandwidth parameter in practice is discussed. Some plug-in (PI)
               type of bandwidth selectors, which are based on non-parametric
               estimation of an approximation of the mean integrated squared
               error, are proposed. The selectors are a refinement of the
               simple normal reference bandwidth selector, which is obtained by
               parametrically estimating the approximated mean integrated
               squared error by referring to a normal density. A simulation
               study compares these PI bandwidth selectors with a bootstrap
               (BT) and a cross-validated (CV) bandwidth selector. It is
               concluded that in finite samples, an appropriately chosen PI
               bandwidth selector and the BT bandwidth selector perform
               comparably and both outperform the CV bandwidth. The use of the

                 the estimation of finite mixture models with an unknown number

                 the number of components, the mixing limitations of standard
                 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques, and the
                 related label switching problem. An overfitting approach is
                 used to estimate the number of components in a finite mixture
                 model via a Zmix algorithm. Zmix provides a bridge between
                 multidimensional samplers and test based estimation methods,
                 whereby priors are chosen to encourage extra groups to have
                 weights approaching zero. MCMC sampling is made possible by
                 the implementation of prior parallel tempering, an extension
                 of parallel tempering. Zmix can accurately estimate the number
                 of components, posterior parameter estimates and allocation
                 probabilities given a sufficiently large sample size. The
                 results will reflect uncertainty in the final model and will
                 report the range of possible candidate models and their
                 respective estimated probabilities from a single run. Label
                 switching is resolved with a computationally light-weight
                 method, Zswitch, developed for overfitted mixtures by
                 exploiting the intuitiveness of allocation-based relabelling
                 algorithms and the precision of label-invariant loss
                 functions. Four simulation studies are included to illustrate
                 Zmix and Zswitch, as well as three case studies from the

                 finite number of subpopulations, a natural model to choose is
                 the finite mixture model. It will often be the case, however,
                 that the number of component distributions is unknown and must
                 be estimated. This problem can be difficult; for instance, the
                 density of two mixed normals is not bimodal unless the means
                 are separated by at least 2 standard deviations. Hence
                 modality of the data per se can be an insensitive approach to
                 component estimation. We demonstrate that a mixture of two
                 normals divided by a normal density having the same mean and
                 variance as the mixed density is always bimodal. This analytic
                 result and other related results form the basis for a
                 diagnostic and a test for the number of components in a
                 mixture of normals. The density is estimated using a kernel
                 density estimator. Under the null hypothesis, the proposed
                 diagnostic can be approximated by a stationary Gaussian
                 process. Under the alternative hypothesis, components in the
                 mixture will express themselves as major modes in the
                 diagnostic plot. A test for mixing is based on the amount of

                 distribution for Bayesian density estimation with Dirichlet
                 mixtures of normal distributions as the prior. The true
                 density is assumed to be twice continuously differentiable.
                 The bandwidth is given a sequence of priors which is obtained
                 by scaling a single prior by an appropriate order. In order to
                 handle this problem, we derive a new general rate theorem by
                 considering a countable covering of the parameter space whose
                 prior probabilities satisfy a summability condition together
                 with certain individual bounds on the Hellinger metric

  abstract    = "We study the rates of convergence of the maximum likelihood
                 estimator (MLE) and posterior distribution in density
                 estimation problems, where the densities are location or
                 location-scale mixtures of normal distributions with the scale
                 parameter lying between two positive numbers. The true density
                 is also assumed to lie in this class with the true mixing
                 distribution either compactly supported or having sub-Gaussian
                 tails. We obtain bounds for Hellinger bracketing entropies for
                 this class, and from these bounds, we deduce the convergence
                 rates of (sieve) MLEs in Hellinger distance. The rate turns
                 out to be (log n)$^\kappa/\sqrt\{n\}$, where $\kappa$$\geq$ 1
                 is a constant that depends on the type of mixtures and the
                 choice of the sieve. Next, we consider a Dirichlet mixture of
                 normals as a prior on the unknown density. We estimate the
                 prior probability of a certain Kullback-Leibler type
                 neighborhood and then invoke a general theorem that computes
                 the posterior convergence rate in terms the growth rate of the
                 Hellinger entropy and the concentration rate of the prior. The
                 posterior distribution is also seen to converge at the rate
                 (log n)$^\kappa/\sqrt\{n\}$ in, where $\kappa$ now depends on

                 in finite mixtures when the mixture components are assumed to
                 be symmetric and to come from the same location family. We
                 refer to these mixtures as semi-parametric because no
                 additional assumptions other than symmetry are made regarding
                 the parametric form of the component distributions. Because
                 the class of symmetric distributions is so broad,
                 identifiability of parameters is a major issue in these
                 mixtures. We develop a notion of identifiability of finite
                 mixture models, which we call k-identifiability, where k
                 denotes the number of components in the mixture. We give
                 sufficient conditions for k-identifiability of location
                 mixtures of symmetric components when k=2 or 3. We propose a
                 novel distance-based method for estimating the (location and
                 mixing) parameters from a k-identifiable model and establish
                 the strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the
                 estimator. In the specific case of L\_2-distance, we show that
                 our estimator generalizes the Hodges--Lehmann estimator. We
                 discuss the numerical implementation of these procedures,
                 along with an empirical estimate of the component
                 distribution, in the two-component case. In comparisons with
                 maximum likelihood estimation assuming normal components, our
                 method produces somewhat higher standard error estimates in
                 the case where the components are truly normal, but
                 dramatically outperforms the normal method when the components

                 generally not obvious, and when it occurs, inference methods

                 Hence, a generalization of the EM algorithm to semiparametric
                 mixture models is proposed. The approach is methodological and
                 can be applied to a wide class of semiparametric mixture

                 Density and Regression in the Presence of Measurement Error",
  author      = "Carroll, Raymond J and Delaigle, Aurore and Hall, Peter",
  abstract    = "In many applications we can expect that, or are interested to
                 know if, a density function or a regression curve satisfies
                 some specific shape constraints. For example, when the
                 explanatory variable, X, represents the value taken by a
                 treatment or dosage, the conditional mean of the response, Y ,
                 is often anticipated to be a monotone function of X. Indeed,
                 if this regression mean is not monotone (in the appropriate
                 direction) then the medical or commercial value of the
                 treatment is likely to be significantly curtailed, at least
                 for values of X that lie beyond the point at which
                 monotonicity fails. In the case of a density, common shape
                 constraints include log-concavity and unimodality. If we can
                 correctly guess the shape of a curve, then nonparametric
                 estimators can be improved by taking this information into
                 account. Addressing such problems requires a method for
                 testing the hypothesis that the curve of interest satisfies a
                 shape constraint, and, if the conclusion of the test is
                 positive, a technique for estimating the curve subject to the
                 constraint. Nonparametric methodology for solving these
                 problems already exists, but only in cases where the
                 covariates are observed precisely. However in many problems,
                 data can only be observed with measurement errors, and the
                 methods employed in the error-free case typically do not carry
                 over to this error context. In this paper we develop a novel
                 approach to hypothesis testing and function estimation under
                 shape constraints, which is valid in the context of
                 measurement errors. Our method is based on tilting an
                 estimator of the density or the regression mean until it
                 satisfies the shape constraint, and we take as our test
                 statistic the distance through which it is tilted. Bootstrap
                 methods are used to calibrate the test. The constrained curve
                 estimators that we develop are also based on tilting, and in
                 that context our work has points of contact with methodology

                 general mixture alternatives. Many tests of this type can be
                 interpreted as C(a) tests, as in Neyman (1959), and shown to
                 be locally, asymptotically optimal. A unified approach to
                 analysing the asymptotic behaviour of such tests will be
                 described, employing a variant of the LeCam LAN framework.
                 These C(a) tests will be contrasted with a new approach to
                 likelihood ratio testing for mixture models. The latter tests
                 are based on estimation of general (nonparametric) mixture

                 solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix

                 An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to

  abstract    = "Abstract The Rasch model for item analysis is an important
                 member of the class of exponential response models in which
                 the number of nuisance parameters increases with the number of
                 subjects, leading to the failure of the usual likelihood
                 methodology. Both conditional-likelihood methods and
                 mixture-model techniques have been used to circumvent these
                 problems. In this article, we show that these seemingly
                 unrelated analyses are in fact closely linked to each other,
                 despite dramatic structural differences between the classes of
                 models implied by each approach. We show that the
                 finite-mixture model for J dichotomous items having T latent
                 classes gives the same estimates of item parameters as
                 conditional likelihood on a set whose probability approaches
                 one if T $\geq$ (J + 1)/2. Unconditional maximum likelihood
                 estimators for the finite-mixture model can be viewed as
                 Keifer-Wolfowitz estimators for the random-effects version of
                 the Rasch model. Latent-class versions of the model are
                 especially attractive when T is small relative to J. We

                 sparse statistical model has only a small number of nonzero
                 parameters or weights; therefore, it is much easier to
                 estimate and interpret than a dense model. Statistical
                 Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents
                 methods that exploit sparsity to help recover the underlying
                 signal in a set of data. Top experts in this rapidly evolving
                 field, the authors describe the lasso for linear regression
                 and a simple coordinate descent algorithm for its computation.
                 They discuss the application of l1 penalties to generalized
                 linear models and support vector machines, cover generalized
                 penalties such as the elastic net and group lasso, and review
                 numerical methods for optimization. They also present
                 statistical inference methods for fitted (lasso) models,
                 including the bootstrap, Bayesian methods, and recently
                 developed approaches. In addition, the book examines matrix
                 decomposition, sparse multivariate analysis, graphical models,
                 and compressed sensing. It concludes with a survey of
                 theoretical results for the lasso. In this age of big data,
                 the number of features measured on a person or object can be
                 large and might be larger than the number of observations.
                 This book shows how the sparsity assumption allows us to
                 tackle these problems and extract useful and reproducible
                 patterns from big datasets. Data analysts, computer

                 estimator unimodal: tilting the empirical distribution. It is
                 proposed that the amount of tilting be chosen in order to
                 minimise, subject to unimodality, the integrated squared
                 distance between a conventional density estimator and its
                 tilted version. This approach has an interesting
                 data-compression aspect, in that the algorithm often
                 implicitly summarises the dataset in a relatively small
                 subsample as part of the process of enforcing unimodality.
                 Another feature is that, no matter what the chosen bandwidth,
                 the algorithm produces (with probability 1, for each sample
                 size) a proper density estimate. Thus, it may be employed as
                 an adjunct to any of the many popular bandwidth selection

                 the mixing proportion, two location parameters and the

                   on the theory of certain random combinatorial structures,
                   and of electrical networks. Much (but not all) of the
                   physical theory of Ising/Potts models is best implemented in
                   the context of the random-cluster representation. This
                   systematic summary of random-cluster models includes
                   accounts of the fundamental methods and inequalities, the
                   uniqueness and specification of infinite-volume measures,
                   the existence and nature of the phase transition, and the
                   structure of the subcritical and supercritical phases. The
                   theory for two-dimensional lattices is better developed than
                   for three and more dimensions. There is a rich collection of

                   for the general area of disordered systems, and these are
                   highlighted when encountered. Amongst the major open
                   questions, there is the problem of ascertaining the exact
                   nature of the phase transition for general values of the

               with an external agency (e.g., a heat reservoir) which causes
               them to change their states randomly with time. Coupling between
               the spins is introduced through the assumption that the
               transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values
               of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in
               part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the
               equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which
               describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case
               of a closed N?member chain. The expectation values of the
               individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of

               follows, for instance, from the Dobrushin-Shlosman uniqueness
               condition for the Gibbs state implies a stronger mixing property
               of the Gibbs state, similar to the Dobrushin-Shlosman complete

  title     = "Cutoff for the Ising model on the lattice",
  author    = "Lubetzky, Eyal and Sly, Allan",
  abstract  = "Introduced in 1963, Glauber dynamics is one of the most
               practiced and extensively studied methods for sampling the Ising
               model on lattices. It is well known that at high temperatures,
               the time it takes this chain to mix in L1 on a system of size n
               is O(logn). Whether in this regime there is cutoff, i.e. a sharp
               transition in the L1-convergence to equilibrium, is a
               fundamental open problem: If so, as conjectured by Peres, it
               would imply that mixing occurs abruptly at (c+o(1))logn for some
               fixed c>0, thus providing a rigorous stopping rule for this MCMC
               sampler. However, obtaining the precise asymptotics of the
               mixing and proving cutoff can be extremely challenging even for
               fairly simple Markov chains. Already for the one-dimensional
               Ising model, showing cutoff is a longstanding open problem.We
               settle the above by establishing cutoff and its location at the
               high temperature regime of the Ising model on the lattice with
               periodic boundary conditions. Our results hold for any dimension
               and at any temperature where there is strong spatial mixing: For
               ℤ2 this carries all the way to the critical temperature.
               Specifically, for fixed d$\geq$1, the continuous-time Glauber
               dynamics for the Ising model on (ℤ/nℤ)d with periodic boundary
               conditions has cutoff at (d/2$\lambda$$\infty$)logn, where
               $\lambda$$\infty$ is the spectral gap of the dynamics on the
               infinite-volume lattice. To our knowledge, this is the first
               time where cutoff is shown for a Markov chain where even
               understanding its stationary distribution is limited.The proof
               hinges on a new technique for translating L1-mixing to L2-mixing
               of projections of the chain, which enables the application of
               logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities. The technique is general and
               carries to other monotone and anti-monotone spin-systems, e.g.
               gas hard-core, Potts, anti-ferromagentic Ising, arbitrary

                   and robust mean estimation, both in high dimensions, that
                   substantially improve upon the statistical guarantees
                   achieved by previous efficient algorithms. Firstly, we study
                   mixtures of $k$ distributions in $d$ dimensions, where the
                   means of every pair of distributions are separated by at
                   least $k^\{\varepsilon\}$. In the special case of spherical
                   Gaussian mixtures, we give a
                   $(dk)^\{O(1/\varepsilon^2)\}$-time algorithm that learns the
                   means assuming separation at least $k^\{\varepsilon\}$, for
                   any $\varepsilon > 0$. This is the first algorithm to
                   improve on greedy (``single-linkage'') and spectral
                   clustering, breaking a long-standing barrier for efficient
                   algorithms at separation $k^\{1/4\}$. We also study robust
                   estimation. When an unknown $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of
                   $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are chosen from a sub-Gaussian distribution
                   with mean $\mu$ but the remaining points are chosen

                   error $\varepsilon^\{1-1/t\}$ in time $d^\{O(t^2)\}$, so
                   long as sub-Gaussian-ness up to $O(t)$ moments can be
                   certified by a Sum of Squares proof. This is the first

               measurement error in regressions rely on some form of additional
               information (e.g., validation data, known error distributions,
               repeated measurements, or instruments). In contrast, we
               establish that the fully nonparametric classical
               errors-in-variables model is identifiable from data on the
               regressor and the dependent variable alone, unless the model
               takes a very specific parametric form. This parametric family
               includes (but is not limited to) the linear specification with
               normally distributed variables as a well-known special case.
               This result relies on standard primitive regularity conditions
               taking the form of smoothness constraints and nonvanishing
               characteristic functions? assumptions. Our approach can handle
               both monotone and nonmonotone specifications, provided the
               latter oscillate a finite number of times. Given that the very
               specific unidentified parametric functional form is arguably the
               exception rather than the rule, this identification result
               should have a wide applicability. It leads to a new perspective
               on handling measurement error in nonlinear and nonparametric
               models, opening the way to a novel and practical approach to
               correct for measurement error in datasets where it was
               previously considered impossible (due to the lack of additional
               information regarding the measurement error). We suggest an
               estimator based on non/semiparametric maximum likelihood, derive
               its asymptotic properties, and illustrate the effectiveness of
               the method with a simulation study and an application to the

               variables X and Z is observed, where Z denotes measurement error
               and has a known distribution, and where the unknown density f of
               X is to be estimated. One application is the estimation of a
               prior density for a sequence of location parameters. A second
               application arises in the errors-in-variables problem for
               nonlinear and generalized linear models, when one attempts to
               model the distribution of the true but unobservable covariates.
               This article shows that if Z is normally distributed and f has k
               bounded derivatives, then the fastest attainable convergence
               rate of any nonparametric estimator of f is only (log n)?k/2.

                 restrictive smoothness assumptions on the signal distribution,

              the Ising model. The traditional approach for obtaining sharp
              mixing results has been to appeal to estimates on spatial
              properties of the stationary measure from within a multi-scale
              analysis of the dynamics. Here we propose to study these
              simultaneously by examining ``information percolation'' clusters
              in the space-time slab. Using this framework, we obtain new
              results for the Ising model on $(\mathbb\{Z\}/n\mathbb\{Z\})^d$
              throughout the high temperature regime: total-variation mixing
              exhibits cutoff with an $O(1)$-window around the time at which
              the magnetization is the square-root of the volume. (Previously,
              cutoff in the full high temperature regime was only known for
              $d\leq 2$, and only with an $O(\log\log n)$-window.) Furthermore,
              the new framework opens the door to understanding the effect of
              the initial state on the mixing time. We demonstrate this on the
              1D Ising model, showing that starting from the uniform
              (``disordered'') initial distribution asymptotically halves the
              mixing time, whereas almost every deterministic starting state is

  author    = "Lindsay, Bruce G and Roeder, Kathryn",
  abstract  = "Abstract A sample is commonly modeled by a mixture distribution
               if the observations follow a common distribution, but the
               parameter of interest differs between observations. For example,
               we observe the lengths but not the ages of a sample offish. It
               may be reasonable to assume that length is normally distributed
               about an unknown mean that depends on the age of the fish.
               Provided there is more than one age class in the sample, then
               the data are distributed as a mixture of normals. In this
               article we assume that the data are a random sample from a
               mixture of exponential family distributions and that for each
               observation the parameter of interest is sampled independently
               from an unknown mixing distribution Q. The adequacy of a fitted
               mixture model can be assessed by examining residuals based on
               the ratio of the observed to expected fit. Residuals based on
               the homogeneity model (in which Q is a one-point distribution)
               display a convexity property when the data follow a mixture
               model; this becomes the basis for diagnostic plots to detect the
               presence of mixing. Similar results also are obtained from
               smoothed residuals; thus the diagnostic also can be applied to
               sparse or continuous data. The nonparametric maximum likelihood
               estimate [Qcirc] of the distribution Q is known to be discrete.
               Smoothed residuals obtained from the fitted mixed model provide
               information about the number of support points in [Qcirc]. This
               facilitates the use of the EM algorithm to find [Qcirc]. The
               residuals evaluated at [Qcirc] determine whether or not the
               maximum likelihood estimate is unique and hence interpretable.

               nonparametric estimation of a density function from an
               $\operatorname\{iid\}$ sample; the maximum of the likelihood is
               not attained by any density. In this example, as in many other

               Given a biometric situation of interest in which, under
               homogeneity assumptions, a certain parametric density occurs,
               such as the Poisson, the binomial, the geometric, the normal,

               be enlarged to allow a variation of the scalar parameter in the
               population. This situation is called unobserved heterogeneity.
               This naturally leads to a specific form of nonparametric mixture
               distribution that can then be assumed to be the standard model
               in the biometric application of interest (since it also

  author    = "Liu, Lei and Zhu, Yu",
  abstract  = "There exist primarily three different types of algorithms for
               computing nonparametric maximum likelihood estimates (NPMLEs) of
               mixing distributions in the literature, which are the EM-type
               algorithms, the vertex direction algorithms such as VDM and VEM,
               and the algorithms based on general constrained optimization
               techniques such as the projected gradient method. It is known
               that the projected gradient algorithm may run into stagnation
               during iterations. When a stagnation occurs, VDM steps need to
               be added. We argue that the abrupt switch to VDM steps can
               significantly reduce the efficiency of the projected gradient
               algorithm, and is usually unnecessary. In this paper, we define
               a group of partially projected directions, which can be regarded
               as hybrids of ordinary projected gradient directions and VDM
               directions. Based on these directions, four new algorithms are
               proposed for computing NPMLEs of mixing distributions. The
               properties of the algorithms are discussed and their convergence
               is proved. Extensive numerical simulations show that the new
               algorithms outperform the existing methods, especially when a
               NPMLE has a large number of support points or when high accuracy
               is required.",

  title     = "A review of reliable maximum likelihood algorithms for
               semiparametric mixture models",
  author    = "B{\"o}hning, Dankmar",
  abstract  = "This contribution reviews some of the major developments in the
               algorithmic area connected with the construction of maximum
               likelihood estimators in semiparametric mixture models. Mixture
               models arise in a natural way in that they are modelling
               unobserved population heterogeneity. It is assumed that the
               population consists of a possibly unknown number k of
               subpopulations with parameters ϑ1, …, ϑk receiving weights
               $\alpha$1, …, $\alpha$k. Since it is not possible to observe the
               subpopulation membership, one can only observe data coming from
               the marginal or mixture density f (x, P) = $\sum$kj = 1f (x,
               ϑj)$\alpha$j with P giving mass $\alpha$j to ϑj. The
               log-likelihood $\lambda$(P) becomes $\sum$i log f (xi, P) and it
               is easily seen that $\lambda$(P) forms a concave functional on
               the convex set of all probability distributions and this
               property in essence produces the basis for the construction
               principles of reliable maximum likelihood algorithms. In Section
               1, the gradient function is discussed. Any optimization
               algorithm needs a search direction and the gradient function
               serves as a basis for finding vertex directions. Section 2
               discusses vertex direction methods. The fundamental idea of
               vertex direction methods is as follows. Consider a vertex Pϑ
               (the probability measure putting all mass at ϑ) and set up the
               convex combination of some current P and Pϑ: (1 − $\alpha$) P +
               $\alpha$Pϑ, where $\alpha$ is called the step-length. Good
               choices will be discussed in the next section. The gradient
               function is used to find the appropriate vertex direction. If ϑ
               is chosen to maximize the gradient function the associated
               convex combination is called the vertex direction method (VDM).
               Large improvements of this method such as the vertex exchange
               method (VEM) or the intra simplex direction method (ISDM) will
               be discussed. In Section 3, the problem of finding a monotonic
               step-length given some current value P and a search direction H
               is studied. The idea of estimating the area above the second
               derivative curve is introduced and related to existing
               algorithms. The concept of area overestimation then leads to the
               monotonicity of the associated algorithm. Section 4 discusses
               the problem of maximizing a concave function of a finite number
               of probabilities. Three algorithmic approaches are discussed:
               the projection approach, the transformation approach and the
               generalized EM approach. Concluding in Section 5, the case of a
               fixed (known) number of components in the mixture model as well
               as software packages available for all mentioned algorithms are
               discussed.",

  title    = "On approximations via convolution-defined mixture models",
  author   = "Nguyen, Hien D and McLachlan, Geoffrey J",
  abstract = "An often-cited fact regarding mixing or mixture distributions is
              that their density functions are able to approximate the density
              function of any unknown distribution to arbitrary degrees of
              accuracy, provided that the mixing or mixture distribution is
              sufficiently complex. This fact is often not made concrete. We
              investigate and review theorems that provide approximation bounds
              for mixing distributions. Connections between the approximation
              bounds of mixing distributions and estimation bounds for the
              maximum likelihood estimator of finite mixtures of location-
              scale distributions are reviewed.",

                   Model",
  author        = "Ganguly, Shirshendu and Seo, Insuk",
  abstract      = "We consider the Random-Cluster model on
                   $(\mathbb\{Z\}/n\mathbb\{Z\})^d$ with parameters $p \in
                   (0,1)$ and $q\ge 1$. This is a generalization of the
                   standard bond percolation (with open probability $p$) which
                   is biased by a factor $q$ raised to the number of connected
                   components. We study the well known FK-dynamics on this
                   model where the update at an edge depends on the global
                   geometry of the system unlike the Glauber Heat Bath dynamics
                   for spin systems, and prove that for all small enough $p$
                   (depending on the dimension) and any $q>1$, the FK-dynamics
                   exhibits the cutoff phenomenon at
                   $\lambda_\{\infty\}^\{-1\}\log n$ with a window size
                   $O(\log\log n)$, where $\lambda_\{\infty\}$ is the large $n$
                   limit of the spectral gap of the process. Our proof extends
                   the Information Percolation framework of Lubetzky and Sly
                   [21] to the Random-Cluster model and also relies on the
                   arguments of Blanca and Sinclair [4] who proved a sharp
                   $O(\log n)$ mixing time bound for the planar version. A key
                   aspect of our proof is the analysis of the effect of a
                   sequence of dependent (across time) Bernoulli percolations
                   extracted from the graphical construction of the dynamics,
                   on how information propagates.",
