  title     = "Frequent problems in calculating integrals and optimizing
               objective functions: a case study in density deconvolution",
  author    = "Delaigle, A and Gijbels, I",
  abstract  = "Many statistical procedures involve calculation of integrals or
               optimization (minimization or maximization) of some objective
               function. In practical implementation of these, the user often
               has to face specific problems such as seemingly numerical
               instability of the integral calculation, choices of grid points,
               appearance of several local minima or maxima, etc. In this paper
               we provide insights into these problems (why and when are they
               happening?), and give some guidelines of how to deal with them.
               Such problems are not new, neither are the ways to deal with
               them, but it is worthwhile to devote serious considerations to
               them. For a transparant and clear discussion of these issues, we
               focus on a particular statistical problem: nonparametric
               estimation of a density from a sample that contains measurement
               errors. The discussions and guidelines remain valid though in
               other contexts. In the density deconvolution setting, a kernel
               density estimator has been studied in detail in the literature.
               The estimator is consistent and fully data-driven procedures
               have been proposed. When implemented in practice however, the
               estimator can turn out to be very inaccurate if no adequate
               numerical procedures are used. We review the steps leading to
               the calculation of the estimator and in selecting parameters of
               the method, and discuss the various problems encountered in
               doing so.",

               considered and the important issue of how to choose the
               bandwidth parameter in practice is discussed. Some plug-in (PI)
               type of bandwidth selectors, which are based on non-parametric
               estimation of an approximation of the mean integrated squared
               error, are proposed. The selectors are a refinement of the
               simple normal reference bandwidth selector, which is obtained by
               parametrically estimating the approximated mean integrated
               squared error by referring to a normal density. A simulation
               study compares these PI bandwidth selectors with a bootstrap
               (BT) and a cross-validated (CV) bandwidth selector. It is
               concluded that in finite samples, an appropriately chosen PI
               bandwidth selector and the BT bandwidth selector perform
               comparably and both outperform the CV bandwidth. The use of the

                 the estimation of finite mixture models with an unknown number
                 of components: the non-identifiability induced by overfitting
                 the number of components, the mixing limitations of standard
                 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques, and the
                 related label switching problem. An overfitting approach is
                 used to estimate the number of components in a finite mixture
                 model via a Zmix algorithm. Zmix provides a bridge between
                 multidimensional samplers and test based estimation methods,
                 whereby priors are chosen to encourage extra groups to have
                 weights approaching zero. MCMC sampling is made possible by
                 the implementation of prior parallel tempering, an extension
                 of parallel tempering. Zmix can accurately estimate the number
                 of components, posterior parameter estimates and allocation
                 probabilities given a sufficiently large sample size. The
                 results will reflect uncertainty in the final model and will
                 report the range of possible candidate models and their
                 respective estimated probabilities from a single run. Label
                 switching is resolved with a computationally light-weight
                 method, Zswitch, developed for overfitted mixtures by
                 exploiting the intuitiveness of allocation-based relabelling
                 algorithms and the precision of label-invariant loss
                 functions. Four simulation studies are included to illustrate
                 Zmix and Zswitch, as well as three case studies from the
                 literature. All methods are available as part of the R package

                 finite number of subpopulations, a natural model to choose is
                 the finite mixture model. It will often be the case, however,
                 that the number of component distributions is unknown and must
                 be estimated. This problem can be difficult; for instance, the
                 density of two mixed normals is not bimodal unless the means
                 are separated by at least 2 standard deviations. Hence
                 modality of the data per se can be an insensitive approach to
                 component estimation. We demonstrate that a mixture of two
                 normals divided by a normal density having the same mean and
                 variance as the mixed density is always bimodal. This analytic
                 result and other related results form the basis for a
                 diagnostic and a test for the number of components in a
                 mixture of normals. The density is estimated using a kernel
                 density estimator. Under the null hypothesis, the proposed
                 diagnostic can be approximated by a stationary Gaussian
                 process. Under the alternative hypothesis, components in the
                 mixture will express themselves as major modes in the
                 diagnostic plot. A test for mixing is based on the amount of
                 smoothing necessary to suppress these large deviations from a

  title       = "Posterior convergence rates of Dirichlet mixtures at smooth
                 densities",
  author      = "Ghosal, Subhashis and van der Vaart, Aad",
  abstract    = "We study the rates of convergence of the posterior
                 distribution for Bayesian density estimation with Dirichlet
                 mixtures of normal distributions as the prior. The true
                 density is assumed to be twice continuously differentiable.
                 The bandwidth is given a sequence of priors which is obtained
                 by scaling a single prior by an appropriate order. In order to
                 handle this problem, we derive a new general rate theorem by
                 considering a countable covering of the parameter space whose
                 prior probabilities satisfy a summability condition together
                 with certain individual bounds on the Hellinger metric
                 entropy. We apply this new general theorem on posterior
                 convergence rates by computing bounds for Hellinger
                 (bracketing) entropy numbers for the involved class of
                 densities, the error in the approximation of a smooth density
                 by normal mixtures and the concentration rate of the prior.
                 The best obtainable rate of convergence of the posterior turns
                 out to be equivalent to the well-known frequentist rate for
                 integrated mean squared error n−2/5 up to a logarithmic
                 factor.",

  title       = "Entropies and Rates of Convergence for Maximum Likelihood and
                 Bayes Estimation for Mixtures of Normal Densities",
  author      = "Ghosal, Subhashis and van der Vaart, Aad W",
  abstract    = "We study the rates of convergence of the maximum likelihood
                 estimator (MLE) and posterior distribution in density
                 estimation problems, where the densities are location or
                 location-scale mixtures of normal distributions with the scale
                 parameter lying between two positive numbers. The true density
                 is also assumed to lie in this class with the true mixing
                 distribution either compactly supported or having sub-Gaussian
                 tails. We obtain bounds for Hellinger bracketing entropies for
                 this class, and from these bounds, we deduce the convergence
                 rates of (sieve) MLEs in Hellinger distance. The rate turns
                 out to be (log n)$^\kappa/\sqrt\{n\}$, where $\kappa$$\geq$ 1
                 is a constant that depends on the type of mixtures and the
                 choice of the sieve. Next, we consider a Dirichlet mixture of
                 normals as a prior on the unknown density. We estimate the
                 prior probability of a certain Kullback-Leibler type
                 neighborhood and then invoke a general theorem that computes
                 the posterior convergence rate in terms the growth rate of the
                 Hellinger entropy and the concentration rate of the prior. The
                 posterior distribution is also seen to converge at the rate
                 (log n)$^\kappa/\sqrt\{n\}$ in, where $\kappa$ now depends on
                 the tail behavior of the base measure of the Dirichlet

                 in finite mixtures when the mixture components are assumed to
                 be symmetric and to come from the same location family. We
                 refer to these mixtures as semi-parametric because no
                 additional assumptions other than symmetry are made regarding
                 the parametric form of the component distributions. Because
                 the class of symmetric distributions is so broad,
                 identifiability of parameters is a major issue in these
                 mixtures. We develop a notion of identifiability of finite
                 mixture models, which we call k-identifiability, where k
                 denotes the number of components in the mixture. We give
                 sufficient conditions for k-identifiability of location
                 mixtures of symmetric components when k=2 or 3. We propose a
                 novel distance-based method for estimating the (location and
                 mixing) parameters from a k-identifiable model and establish
                 the strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the
                 estimator. In the specific case of L\_2-distance, we show that
                 our estimator generalizes the Hodges--Lehmann estimator. We
                 discuss the numerical implementation of these procedures,
                 along with an empirical estimate of the component
                 distribution, in the two-component case. In comparisons with
                 maximum likelihood estimation assuming normal components, our
                 method produces somewhat higher standard error estimates in
                 the case where the components are truly normal, but
                 dramatically outperforms the normal method when the components

                 distributions. Identifiability of such model parameters is
                 generally not obvious, and when it occurs, inference methods
                 are rather specific to the mixture model under consideration.
                 Hence, a generalization of the EM algorithm to semiparametric
                 mixture models is proposed. The approach is methodological and
                 can be applied to a wide class of semiparametric mixture
                 models. The behavior of the proposed EM type estimators is

  abstract    = "In many applications we can expect that, or are interested to
                 know if, a density function or a regression curve satisfies
                 some specific shape constraints. For example, when the
                 explanatory variable, X, represents the value taken by a
                 treatment or dosage, the conditional mean of the response, Y ,
                 is often anticipated to be a monotone function of X. Indeed,
                 if this regression mean is not monotone (in the appropriate
                 direction) then the medical or commercial value of the
                 treatment is likely to be significantly curtailed, at least
                 for values of X that lie beyond the point at which
                 monotonicity fails. In the case of a density, common shape
                 constraints include log-concavity and unimodality. If we can
                 correctly guess the shape of a curve, then nonparametric
                 estimators can be improved by taking this information into
                 account. Addressing such problems requires a method for
                 testing the hypothesis that the curve of interest satisfies a
                 shape constraint, and, if the conclusion of the test is
                 positive, a technique for estimating the curve subject to the
                 constraint. Nonparametric methodology for solving these
                 problems already exists, but only in cases where the
                 covariates are observed precisely. However in many problems,
                 data can only be observed with measurement errors, and the
                 methods employed in the error-free case typically do not carry
                 over to this error context. In this paper we develop a novel
                 approach to hypothesis testing and function estimation under
                 shape constraints, which is valid in the context of
                 measurement errors. Our method is based on tilting an
                 estimator of the density or the regression mean until it
                 satisfies the shape constraint, and we take as our test
                 statistic the distance through which it is tilted. Bootstrap
                 methods are used to calibrate the test. The constrained curve
                 estimators that we develop are also based on tilting, and in
                 that context our work has points of contact with methodology

                 interest naturally focuses on testing for homogeneity versus
                 general mixture alternatives. Many tests of this type can be
                 interpreted as C(a) tests, as in Neyman (1959), and shown to
                 be locally, asymptotically optimal. A unified approach to
                 analysing the asymptotic behaviour of such tests will be
                 described, employing a variant of the LeCam LAN framework.
                 These C(a) tests will be contrasted with a new approach to
                 likelihood ratio testing for mixture models. The latter tests
                 are based on estimation of general (nonparametric) mixture
                 models using the Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956) maximum

                 are shown to dramatically improve upon earlier EM methods for
                 computation of these estimators, and new results on the large
                 sample behaviour of likelihood rations involving such
                 estimators yield a tractable form of asymptotic inference. We

                 avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified
                 and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the
                 coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be
                 improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the
                 calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use
                 the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured
                 data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD
                 signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct
                 solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix
                 inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters.
                 An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to
                 approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does

  abstract    = "Abstract The Rasch model for item analysis is an important
                 member of the class of exponential response models in which
                 the number of nuisance parameters increases with the number of
                 subjects, leading to the failure of the usual likelihood
                 methodology. Both conditional-likelihood methods and
                 mixture-model techniques have been used to circumvent these
                 problems. In this article, we show that these seemingly
                 unrelated analyses are in fact closely linked to each other,
                 despite dramatic structural differences between the classes of
                 models implied by each approach. We show that the
                 finite-mixture model for J dichotomous items having T latent
                 classes gives the same estimates of item parameters as
                 conditional likelihood on a set whose probability approaches
                 one if T $\geq$ (J + 1)/2. Unconditional maximum likelihood
                 estimators for the finite-mixture model can be viewed as
                 Keifer-Wolfowitz estimators for the random-effects version of
                 the Rasch model. Latent-class versions of the model are
                 especially attractive when T is small relative to J. We
                 analyze several sets of data, propose simple diagnostic
                 checks, and discuss procedures for assigning scores to
                 subjects based on posterior means. A flexible and general

                 sparse statistical model has only a small number of nonzero
                 parameters or weights; therefore, it is much easier to
                 estimate and interpret than a dense model. Statistical
                 Learning with Sparsity: The Lasso and Generalizations presents
                 methods that exploit sparsity to help recover the underlying
                 signal in a set of data. Top experts in this rapidly evolving
                 field, the authors describe the lasso for linear regression
                 and a simple coordinate descent algorithm for its computation.
                 They discuss the application of l1 penalties to generalized
                 linear models and support vector machines, cover generalized
                 penalties such as the elastic net and group lasso, and review
                 numerical methods for optimization. They also present
                 statistical inference methods for fitted (lasso) models,
                 including the bootstrap, Bayesian methods, and recently
                 developed approaches. In addition, the book examines matrix
                 decomposition, sparse multivariate analysis, graphical models,
                 and compressed sensing. It concludes with a survey of
                 theoretical results for the lasso. In this age of big data,
                 the number of features measured on a person or object can be
                 large and might be larger than the number of observations.
                 This book shows how the sparsity assumption allows us to
                 tackle these problems and extract useful and reproducible
                 patterns from big datasets. Data analysts, computer

                 proposed that the amount of tilting be chosen in order to
                 minimise, subject to unimodality, the integrated squared
                 distance between a conventional density estimator and its
                 tilted version. This approach has an interesting
                 data-compression aspect, in that the algorithm often
                 implicitly summarises the dataset in a relatively small
                 subsample as part of the process of enforcing unimodality.
                 Another feature is that, no matter what the chosen bandwidth,
                 the algorithm produces (with probability 1, for each sample
                 size) a proper density estimate. Thus, it may be employed as
                 an adjunct to any of the many popular bandwidth selection
                 rules for density estimation. We show theoretically that in
                 classes of densities that are of practical interest, the
                 method enhances performance without suffering any deleterious
                 first-order impact on asymptotic accuracy, for example as
                 reflected in integrated squared error. In such cases, and
                 except in places where the true density is virtually flat, the
                 constrained density estimate is first-order equivalent to its
                 unconstrained counterpart. The case where the number of modes
                 is constrained to equal a number greater than 1 is also

               with an external agency (e.g., a heat reservoir) which causes

               the spins is introduced through the assumption that the
               transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values
               of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in
               part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the
               equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which
               describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case
               of a closed N?member chain. The expectation values of the

  author    = "Lubetzky, Eyal and Sly, Allan",
  abstract  = "Introduced in 1963, Glauber dynamics is one of the most
               practiced and extensively studied methods for sampling the Ising
               model on lattices. It is well known that at high temperatures,
               the time it takes this chain to mix in L1 on a system of size n
               is O(logn). Whether in this regime there is cutoff, i.e. a sharp
               transition in the L1-convergence to equilibrium, is a
               fundamental open problem: If so, as conjectured by Peres, it
               would imply that mixing occurs abruptly at (c+o(1))logn for some
               fixed c>0, thus providing a rigorous stopping rule for this MCMC
               sampler. However, obtaining the precise asymptotics of the
               mixing and proving cutoff can be extremely challenging even for
               fairly simple Markov chains. Already for the one-dimensional
               Ising model, showing cutoff is a longstanding open problem.We
               settle the above by establishing cutoff and its location at the
               high temperature regime of the Ising model on the lattice with
               periodic boundary conditions. Our results hold for any dimension
               and at any temperature where there is strong spatial mixing: For
               ℤ2 this carries all the way to the critical temperature.
               Specifically, for fixed d$\geq$1, the continuous-time Glauber
               dynamics for the Ising model on (ℤ/nℤ)d with periodic boundary
               conditions has cutoff at (d/2$\lambda$$\infty$)logn, where
               $\lambda$$\infty$ is the spectral gap of the dynamics on the
               infinite-volume lattice. To our knowledge, this is the first
               time where cutoff is shown for a Markov chain where even
               understanding its stationary distribution is limited.The proof
               hinges on a new technique for translating L1-mixing to L2-mixing
               of projections of the chain, which enables the application of
               logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities. The technique is general and
               carries to other monotone and anti-monotone spin-systems, e.g.
               gas hard-core, Potts, anti-ferromagentic Ising, arbitrary

  title         = "Mixture Models, Robustness, and Sum of Squares Proofs",
  author        = "Hopkins, Samuel B and Li, Jerry",
  abstract      = "We use the Sum of Squares method to develop new efficient
                   algorithms for learning well-separated mixtures of Gaussians
                   and robust mean estimation, both in high dimensions, that
                   substantially improve upon the statistical guarantees
                   achieved by previous efficient algorithms. Firstly, we study
                   mixtures of $k$ distributions in $d$ dimensions, where the
                   means of every pair of distributions are separated by at
                   least $k^\{\varepsilon\}$. In the special case of spherical
                   Gaussian mixtures, we give a
                   $(dk)^\{O(1/\varepsilon^2)\}$-time algorithm that learns the
                   means assuming separation at least $k^\{\varepsilon\}$, for
                   any $\varepsilon > 0$. This is the first algorithm to
                   improve on greedy (``single-linkage'') and spectral
                   clustering, breaking a long-standing barrier for efficient
                   algorithms at separation $k^\{1/4\}$. We also study robust
                   estimation. When an unknown $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of
                   $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are chosen from a sub-Gaussian distribution
                   with mean $\mu$ but the remaining points are chosen
                   adversarially, we give an algorithm recovering $\mu$ to
                   error $\varepsilon^\{1-1/t\}$ in time $d^\{O(t^2)\}$, so
                   long as sub-Gaussian-ness up to $O(t)$ moments can be
                   certified by a Sum of Squares proof. This is the first
                   polynomial-time algorithm with guarantees approaching the
                   information-theoretic limit for non-Gaussian distributions.
                   Previous algorithms could not achieve error better than
                   $\varepsilon^\{1/2\}$. Both of these results are based on a
                   unified technique. Inspired by recent algorithms of
                   Diakonikolas et al. in robust statistics, we devise an SDP
                   based on the Sum of Squares method for the following
                   setting: given $X_1,\ldots,X_n \in \mathbb\{R\}^d$ for large
                   $d$ and $n = poly(d)$ with the promise that a subset of
                   $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ were sampled from a probability
                   distribution with bounded moments, recover some information
                   about that distribution.",

               variables X and Z is observed, where Z denotes measurement error
               and has a known distribution, and where the unknown density f of
               X is to be estimated. One application is the estimation of a
               prior density for a sequence of location parameters. A second
               application arises in the errors-in-variables problem for
               nonlinear and generalized linear models, when one attempts to
               model the distribution of the true but unobservable covariates.
               This article shows that if Z is normally distributed and f has k
               bounded derivatives, then the fastest attainable convergence
               rate of any nonparametric estimator of f is only (log n)?k/2.
               Therefore, deconvolution with normal errors may not be a
               practical proposition. Other error distributions are also
               treated. Stefanski?Carroll (1987a) estimators achieve the

                 consistently a density or distribution from a sample of data

                 that the noise distribution is completely known or that an
                 additional sample of replicated or validation data is
                 available. Methods also have been suggested for estimating the

                 restrictive smoothness assumptions on the signal distribution,
                 which can be difficult to verify in practice. We take a

                 estimate the signal distributions by using a simple procedure.

                 in variables, such as non-parametric regression estimation.

  abstract = "We introduce a new framework for analyzing Glauber dynamics for
              the Ising model. The traditional approach for obtaining sharp
              mixing results has been to appeal to estimates on spatial
              properties of the stationary measure from within a multi-scale
              analysis of the dynamics. Here we propose to study these
              simultaneously by examining ``information percolation'' clusters
              in the space-time slab. Using this framework, we obtain new
              results for the Ising model on $(\mathbb\{Z\}/n\mathbb\{Z\})^d$
              throughout the high temperature regime: total-variation mixing
              exhibits cutoff with an $O(1)$-window around the time at which
              the magnetization is the square-root of the volume. (Previously,
              cutoff in the full high temperature regime was only known for
              $d\leq 2$, and only with an $O(\log\log n)$-window.) Furthermore,
              the new framework opens the door to understanding the effect of
              the initial state on the mixing time. We demonstrate this on the
              1D Ising model, showing that starting from the uniform
              (``disordered'') initial distribution asymptotically halves the
              mixing time, whereas almost every deterministic starting state is
